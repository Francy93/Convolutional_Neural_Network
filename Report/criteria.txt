Marking scheme:

Points	Area
20	Report
20	Running Code
20	Quality of Code
20	Quality of Algorithm
20	Quality of Results

You should write a brief (1-2 page) report on your system. 
This should describe the algorithm you used, and why you chose this algorithm. 
It should also show the results of a two fold test using the provided data; 
a brief discussion of data usage would be useful.

Quality of code and algorithm are important for good marks. 
The code should be well commented and structured. 
Selection of a good algorithm is also important. 
Simple algorithms may be effective, but a relatively complex algorithm may get you more points just for effort.

Finally, the quality of the results do matter. 
To get reasonable marks you need to surpass the baseline reported on the UCI website. 
This is not a competition between students, but discussing performance with your colleagues will be useful.

Note for scraping by: the base line reported on UCI website is nearest neighbor using Euclidean distance. 
You should be able to implement this quite easily (and might want to start with this). 
This should be enough to pass (10 report, 20 running, 10 code, and 5 results).

Please submit the code, the mark sheet, and analysis to the coursework 2 folder of CST 3170 on myunihub.
